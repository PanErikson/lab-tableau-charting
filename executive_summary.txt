The company has customers across five U.S. states, with California and Oregon accounting for the largest share of the customer base. The customer population shows a relatively even gender distribution, with slightly more female customers than male. The most common employment status among customers is employed, followed by unemployed.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) does not appear to be strongly explained by income. There is no clear upward trend between income and CLTV as might typically be expected. Notably, a significant portion of unemployed customers with zero reported income exhibit positive CLTV, with some extreme cases exceeding 40,000. For the remainder of the customer base, the relationship between income and CLTV appears largely random, suggesting that income alone is not a strong predictor of customer value.

In terms of claims, small vehicles have the highest median total claim amount per customer, making them the most expensive vehicle size in typical claims. They are followed by large vehicles, while midsize vehicles have the lowest median claim amount. However, midsize vehicles display the greatest variability, with several high-cost outliers approaching the 3,000 mark. Small vehicles show the least spread, indicating more consistent claim amounts.
